The new upgraded version of the test command \\[\\[ (double brackets) is supported on most modern systems using Bash, Zsh, and Ksh as a default shell. To negate the test expression, use the logical NOT (!) operator. When comparing strings , always use single or double quotes to avoid word splitting and globbing issues.\n\n### Most commonly used operators:\n\n- `-n VAR` \\- True if the length of VAR is greater than zero.\n- `-z VAR` \\- True if the VAR is empty.\n- `STRING1 = STRING2` \\- True if `STRING1` and `STRING2` are equal.\n- `STRING1 != STRING2`\\- True if `STRING1` and `STRING2` are not equal.\n- `INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2` \\- True if `INTEGER1` and `INTEGER2` are equal.\n- `INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2` \\- True if `INTEGER1` is greater than `INTEGER2`.\n- `INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2` \\- True if `INTEGER1` is less than `INTEGER2`.\n- `INTEGER1 -ge INTEGER2` \\- True if `INTEGER1` is equal or greater than `INTEGER2`.\n- `INTEGER1 -le INTEGER2` \\- True if `INTEGER1` is equal or less than `INTEGER2`.\n- `-h FILE` \\- True if the `FILE` exists and is a symbolic link.\n- `-r FILE` \\- True if the `FILE` exists and is readable.\n- `-w FILE`\\- True if the `FILE` exists and is writable.\n- `-x FILE` \\- True if the `FILE` exists and is executable.\n- `-d FILE` \\- True if the `FILE` exists and is a directory.\n- `-e FILE` \\- True if the `FILE` exists and is a file, regardless of type (node, directory, socket, etc.).\n- `-f FILE` \\- True if the `FILE` exists and is a regular file (not a directory or device).\n\n### if Statement\n\nBash if conditionals can have different forms. The most basic if statement takes the following form:\n\n```cmake\nif TEST-COMMAND\nthen\n  STATEMENTS\nfi\n```\n\n### if..else Statement\n\nThe Bash if..else statement takes the following form:\n\n```cmake\nif TEST-COMMAND\nthen\n  STATEMENTS1\nelse\n  STATEMENTS2\nfi\n```\n\n# if..elif..else Statement\n\nThe Bash if..elif..else statement takes the following form:\n\n```bash\nif TEST-COMMAND1\nthen\n  STATEMENTS1\nelif TEST-COMMAND2\nthen\n  STATEMENTS2\nelse\n  STATEMENTS3\nfi\n```",

We need to execute scripts, modify files, and run processes in order to administer systems effectively, but what happens when we see *Permission denied*? Do you know why we see this message? If you know the cause of the problem, do you know how to implement the solution?\n\nI will give a quick explanation of the various ways to calculate permissions, and then we will focus on the special permissions within Linux. If you want an in-depth look at the `chmod` command, check out this article from Sudoer Shashank Hegde, <ins>Linux permissions: An introduction to chmod</ins>.\n\nThe <ins>TL;DR</ins> is that there are two main ways of assigning permissions.\n\n#### Symbolic method\n\nThe symbolic method uses the following syntax:\n\n```crystal\n[tcarrigan@server ~]$ chmod WhoWhatWhich file | directory\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n- **Who** - represents identities: u,g,o,a (user, group, other, all)\n- **What** - represents actions: +, -, = (add, remove, set exact)\n- **Which** - represents access levels: r, w, x (read, write, execute)\n\nAn example of this is if I want to *add* the *read* and *write* permissions to a file named *test.txt* for *user* and *group*, I use the following command:\n\n```crystal\n[tcarrigan@server ~]$ chmod ug+rw test.txt\n```\n\nFull disclosure, this is not my preferred method of assigning permissions, and if you would like more information around this method, I recommend your nearest search engine.\n\n#### Numeric method\n\nThe numeric method is, in my experience, the best way to learn and practice permissions. It is based on the following syntax:\n\n```clean\n[tcarrigan@server ~]$ chmod ### file | directory\n```\n\nHere, from left to right, the character **#** represents an access level. There are three access levels—user, group, and others. To determine what each digit is, we use the following:\n\n- Start at 0\n- If the *read* permission should be set, add **4**\n- If the *write* permission should be set, add **2**\n- If the *execute* permission should be set, add **1**\n\nThis is calculated on a per access level basis. Let's interpret this permissions example:\n\n```ada\n-rw-r-x---\n```\n\nThe permissions are represented as **650**. How did I arrive at those numbers?\n\n- The user's permissions are: **rw-** or 4+2=**6**\n- The group's permissions are: **r-x** or 4+1=**5**\n- The others's permissions are: **\\---** or **0**\n\nTo put this into the command syntax, it looks like this:\n\n```crystal\n[tcarrigan@server ~]$ chmod 650 test.txt\n```\n\nNow that you understand the basics of permission calculation in Linux, let's look at the *special permissions* included in the OS.\n\n***\\[ You might also like: <ins>An introduction to Linux Access Control Lists (ACLs)</ins> \\]***\n\n## Special permission explained\n\nSpecial permissions make up a fourth access level in addition to **user**, **group**, and **other**. Special permissions allow for additional privileges over the standard permission sets (as the name suggests). There is a special permission option for each access level discussed previously. Let's take a look at each one individually, beginning with Set UID:\n\n## user + s (pecial)\n\nCommonly noted as **SUID**, the special permission for the user access level has a single function: A file with **SUID** always executes as the user who owns the file, regardless of the user passing the command. If the file owner doesn't have execute permissions, then use an uppercase **S** here.\n\nNow, to see this in a practical light, let's look at the `/usr/bin/passwd` command. This command, by default, has the SUID permission set:\n\n```awk\n[tcarrigan@server ~]$ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd \n-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 33544 Dec 13  2019 /usr/bin/passwd\n```\n\nNote the **s** where **x** would usually indicate execute permissions for the user.\n\n## group + s (pecial)\n\nCommonly noted as **SGID**, this special permission has a couple of functions:\n\n- If set on a file, it allows the file to be executed as the **group** that owns the file (similar to SUID)\n- If set on a directory, any files created in the directory will have their **group** ownership set to that of the directory owner\n\n```tap\n[tcarrigan@server article_submissions]$ ls -l \ntotal 0\ndrwxrws---. 2 tcarrigan tcarrigan 69 Apr 7 11:31 my_articles\n```\n\nThis permission set is noted by a lowercase **s** where the **x** would normally indicate **execute** privileges for the **group**. It is also especially useful for directories that are often used in collaborative efforts between members of a group. Any member of the group can access any new file. This applies to the execution of files, as well. **SGID** is very powerful when utilized properly.\n\nAs noted previously for **SUID**, if the owning group does not have execute permissions, then an uppercase **S** is used.\n\n## other + t (sticky)\n\nThe last special permission has been dubbed the \"sticky bit.\" This permission does not affect individual files. However, at the directory level, it restricts file deletion. Only the **owner** (and **root**) of a file can remove the file within that directory. A common example of this is the `/tmp` directory:\n\n```awk\n[tcarrigan@server article_submissions]$ ls -ld /tmp/\ndrwxrwxrwt. 15 root root 4096 Sep 22 15:28 /tmp/\n```\n\nThe permission set is noted by the lowercase **t**, where the **x** would normally indicate the execute privilege.\n\n## Setting special permissions\n\nTo set special permissions on a file or directory, you can utilize either of the two methods outlined for standard permissions above: Symbolic or numerical.\n\nLet's assume that we want to set **SGID** on the directory `community_content`.\n\nTo do this using the symbolic method, we do the following:\n\n```crystal\n[tcarrigan@server article_submissions]$ chmod g+s community_content/\n```\n\nUsing the numerical method, we need to pass a fourth, preceding digit in our `chmod` command. The digit used is calculated similarly to the standard permission digits:\n\n- Start at 0\n- SUID = 4\n- SGID = 2\n- Sticky = 1\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n```clean\n[tcarrigan@server ~]$ chmod X### file | directory\n```\n\nWhere **X** is the special permissions digit.\n\nHere is the command to set **SGID** on `community_content` using the numerical method:\n\n```crystal\n[tcarrigan@server article_submissions]$ chmod 2770 community_content/\n[tcarrigan@server article_submissions]$ ls -ld community_content/\ndrwxrws---. 2 tcarrigan tcarrigan 113 Apr  7 11:32 community_content/\n```\n\n***\\[ Free download: <ins>Advanced Linux commands cheat sheet.</ins> \\]***\n\n## Summary\n\nIn closing, permissions are fundamentally important to being an effective Linux administrator. There are two defined ways to set permissions using the `chmod` command: Symbolic and numerical. We examined the syntax and calculations required for both methods. We also considered the special permissions and their role in the system.

Of course, you can indicate a single line through its corresponding number instead of a range.\n\n3. **Using regular expressions (advanced substitution) – I**\nSometimes configuration files are loaded with comments. While this is certainly useful, it may be helpful to display only the configuration directives sometimes if you want to view them all at a glance. The caret sign followed by the number sign (^#) indicates the beginning of a line, whereas ^$ represents blank lines. The vertical bars indicate boolean operations, whereas the backward slash is used to escape the vertical bars.\nIn this particular case, the Apache configuration file has lines with #’s not at the beginning of some lines, so *# is used to remove those as well.\nTo remove empty lines or those beginning with # from the Apache configuration file, do:\n\n4. **Using regular expressions (advanced substitution) – II**\nTo replace a word beginning with uppercase or lowercase with another word, we can also use sed. To illustrate, let’s replace the word zip or Zip with rar in myfile.txt:\n\n5. **Inserting spaces in files**\n5.1 With sed, we can also insert spaces (blank lines) for each non-empty line in a file. To insert one blank line every other line in LICENSE, a plain text file, do: \n5.2 Add an uppercase G separated by a semicolon if you want to add more blank lines. The following image illustrates the example outlined in this tip:\n\n6. **Emulating dos2unix with inline editing**\nThe dos2unix program converts plain text files from Windows/Mac formatting to Unix/Linux, removing hidden newline characters inserted by some text editors used in those platforms. If it is not installed in your Linux system, you can mimic its functionality with sed instead of installing it. Please note that the -i option indicate in-place editing. Then changes will not be returned to the screen, but will be saved to the file. You can insert DOS newline characters while editing a file in vim editor with Ctrl+V and Ctrl+M.\n\n7. **In-place editing and backing up original file**\nIn the previous tip we used sed to modify a file but did not save the original file. Sometimes it’s a good idea to save a backup copy of the original file just in case. To do that, indicate a suffix following the -i option (inside single quotes) to be used to rename the original file. In the following example we will replace all instances of this or This (ignoring case) with that in myfile.txt, and we will save the original file as myfile.txt.orig. Finally, we will use diff utility to identify the differences between both files:\n\n8. **Switching pairs of words**\nLet’s suppose you have a file containing full names in the format First name, Last name. To adequately process the file, you may want to switch Last name and First name. We can do that with sed fairly easily.\n\n9. **Replacing words only if a separate match is found**\nSometimes replacing all instances of a given word, or a random few, is not precisely what we need. Perhaps we need to perform the replacement if a separate match is found. For example, we may want to replace start with stop only if the word services is found in the same line. In that scenario, here’s what will happen.\n`\nWe need to start partying at work,\nbut let’s remember to start all services first.\n`\nIn the first line, start will not be replaced with stop since the word services does not appear in that line, as opposed to the second line.\n\n10. **Performing two or more substitutions at once**\nYou can combine two or more substitutions one single sed command. Let’s replace the words that and line in myfile.txt with This and verse, respectively. Note how this can be done by using an ordinary sed substitution command followed by a semicolon and a second substitution command.\n\n11. **Combining sed and other commands**\nOf course, sed can be combined with other tools in order to create more powerful commands. For example, let’s use the example given in TIP #4 and extract our IP address from the output of the ip route command. We will begin by printing only the line where the word src is. Then we will convert multiple spaces into a single one. Finally, we will cut the 9th field (considering a single space as field separator), which is where the IP address is.\n\n# sed to replace content in files\nreplace entire lines with empty lines, replace specific strings\n```bash\n#Replace all lines starting with 'Tags: ' with an empty line\nsed -E 's/Tags: (.*)//g' *.md\n\n#Replace all strings 'Status: Completed' with 'Completed: y'\nsed -E 's/Status: Complete/Completed: y/g' *.md\n\n#Remove the first n lines. Below example removes the first 2 lines\nsed -E '1,2d' *.md\n```\n- `-i` [SUFFIX] - edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied), ie applies substitution in the file(s). Without this it displays the substituted file content on terminal\n- `-E` extended RegEx\n\n# find command with only file name\nfind command but displays only file name in the output\n```bash\nfind . -type f -printf \"%f\\n\"\n```\n",

Inside a character class, only the character class metacharacters (backslash, circumflex anchor and hyphen) have special meaning.\n\nYou must use a backslash when you use character class metacharacters as literals inside a character class only. Square brackets that are used as literals must always be escaped with backslash, both inside and outside a character class.\n\nFor example, [[abc] should be written: [[abc]\n\n- \\ (backslash) - general escape character\n- ^ (circumflex anchor) - negate the class, if this is the first character in the brackets (If ^ is not the first, it is not a metacharacter.)\n\n",
